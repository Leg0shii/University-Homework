				I close my eyes, tell us why must we suffer?
				Release your hands, for your will drags us under.
				My legs grow tired, tell us where must we wander?
				How can we carry on if redemption's beyond us?

				To all of my children in whom Life flows abundant.
				To all of my children in whom Death hath passed his judgement.
				The soul years for honour, and the flesh the hereafter.
				Look to those who walked before to lead those who walked after.

				Shining is the Land's light of justice.
				Ever flows the Land's well of purpose.
				Walk free, walk free, walk free, believe...
				The Land is alive, so believe...

				Now open your eyes while our plight is repeated.
				Still deaf to our cries, lost in hope we lie defeated.
				Our souls have been torn and our bodies forsaken.
				Bearing sins of the past, for our future is taken.

				War born of strife, these trials persuade us not.
				[Feel what?] [Learn what?]
				Words without sound, these lies betray our thoughts.
				Mired by a plague of doubt, the Land, she mourns.
				[See what?] [Hear what?]
				Judgement binds all we hold to a memory of scorn.
				Tell us why, given Life, we are meant to die, helpless in our cries?

				Thy Life is a riddle, to bear rapture and sorrow.
				To listen, to suffer, to entrust unto tomorrow.
				In one fleeting moment, from the Land doth life flow.
				Yet in one fleeting moment, for anew it doth grow.
				In that same fleeting moment,
				Thou must live
				Die
				And know.

				Wrought from the rock that stands upon old,
				With heart of black and a stare that's cold.
				Cold are the hands that grasp at your soul,
				'Fore the graves are dug and the death knells toll.

				Tempered in the flows of the mountain's core,
				Where the rage runs red twixt shore and shore.
				Shorn from the world 'neath the blazing sun,
				Bound to the dark, for the light I shun!

				Bow down, overdweller! (Under the weight)

				Bow down, overdweller! (Under the weight)
				Bow down, overdweller! (In hell I wait)
				Bow down, overdweller! (Under the weight)
				Bow down, overdweller! (Under the weight)
				Bow down, overdweller! (Under the weight)
				Succumb to the hate that corrupts your fate!

				Into the dark of an endless night,
				Where the pulse of the land offers no respite.
				In spite of the blood that was spilled before,
				You whet your blades, you thirst for more.

				Now kneel overdweller, your lord commands,
				There's no salvation for the sons of man.
				The skies will tremble and the earth will quake,
				From the crumbling walls no one escapes!

				Bow down, overdweller! (Under the weight)

				Soul without a name, heed my call
				Sin doth stain the hearts of us all
				The worm hath burrowed deep and hath grown
				Soon he too shall reap what is sown

				Step into the storm, know its mercy
				Let the wind and the rain crash down over thee
				Lightning bright, thunder bold
				Guiding us forevermore

				Soul fallen from grace, ware thee well
				Judgment thou must face, thine own hell
				The worm stirreth within, black as night
				Breeding deeper sin, foul its blight

				Soul, thine end is nigh. Take mine hand
				All life must return to the land
				Lingered hath the worm, overlong
				Purge thy flesh of fear and be strong

				Step in from the storm, praise its mercy
				Let the sting of the rain ne'er stray far from thee
				Lightning bright, thunder bold
				Freeing us forevermore

				Now lift thine heavy head and vanquish thy sorrow
				Lightning doth strike
				Thunder doth roll

				Now turn thy gaze ahead and look to the morrow
				Lightning shall strike
				Thunder shall roll on

			<![CDATA[ 
				Staring at death, I take a breath, there's nothing left.
				Now close my eyes, for one last time, and say goodbye.
				Lying naked while the snow falls all around me;
				Drifting closer to the edge but She won't have me!
				Wake up in sweat, full of regret, try to forget.
				These memories, lurking beneath, lost in a dream...

				Unchosen paths, a broken past, forespoken wrath.
				The pain won't cease, I'll find no peace, no sweet release.
				Fragile creatures, we are taught to fear the Reaper;
				Ever running, we are dead before we meet Her!
				These voices telling me let it go! (Let it all go!)
				I try and try but I can't say no! (Try and say no!)
				This endless nightmare has just begun! (Nowhere to run!)
				My heart is dragging me down into oblivion!

				The endless lies, I've cast aside, locked them in ice.
				Steeled is my soul, my blood grown cold, I've gained control.
				Fearless creatures, we all learn to fight the Reaper;
				Can't defeat Her, so instead I'll have to be Her!
				These voices screaming to let it go! (Never let go!)
				This time I'm screaming back no no no! (Go on say no!)
				My mind's made up, yeah my fear is gone! (Where have you gone?)
				Open my eyes now here I come, oblivion!

				For the last time (I won't say goodbye)
				For the last time (I won't say goodbye)
				For the last time (I won't say goodbye)
				For the last time

				Vales deep and forests dark
				Betrayed by loyal hands, Her wrath stirred

				Bound fast unto our fate
				One path, one burden great
				Yet ever do our aching souls, point Heavensward
				Ever rings out our song.

				Yes, ever do our aching souls march Heavensward

				Guide us, O mighty Fury!
				Guide us to victory!

			<![CDATA[ 
				Children of the land, do you hear?
				Echoes of truths that once rang clear.
				Two souls intertwined,
				One true love they did find,
				Bringing land and heavens near.

				But flames that burn full bright soon fell dark.
				Memories dimmed by shadowed hearts.
				In the waxing gloom,
				Did wane the lover's moon,
				Watching as their worlds drift apart.

				One soul's cry, a passion dwelling within.
				Sacrifice, a final plea to her kin!
				Yet this bond of hope,
				By treachery was broke,
				Scattering her words to the wind.

				Swelling overlong, seas of blood, are a song
				And death an afterthought,
				To those who fight for naught.

				A throne, lying empty...
				A reign incomplete.
				Alone for eternity...
				A pain without cease.

				Children of the land answer this:
				Why must you turn to empty bliss?
				Why break trust?
				Why turn the past to dust?
				Seeking solace in the abyss.

				Tell me why create a circle none can break?
				Why must you let go the life you were bestowed?
				This I'll fear I'll never know!

				Never know...

				Seeking the peace of reason
				Sheep in a peaceless season
				Reason to keep believing
				Waken the beast who's sleeping

				Let go this destiny, you're caught in a trance
				Ever marking time inside a dream, no sign of advance
				You see, the mortal coil we serve is taut like a spring
				Step back! Two-step, two-step, two-step one two three

				Our world's a fantasy, no more than a test
				Ever feeding off the fallacy creating this mess
				Deep down inside this bleak machine with all the rest
				Break free! Two-phase, two-phase electricity

				Time turning up the volume
				Time turning on us always
				No time enough tomorrow
				For turning back to where we began

				Twenty-two sectors tested
				Fragments in one direction
				Celestial noise detected
				Delirium unsuspected
				Static tuned in to reason
				Time in the aether deepens
				Transmissions blink uncompleted
				Seven two three two three...<send>

				Arrested destiny, alone in a trance
				No escaping from this waking dream, no hope for advance,
				You see, the mortal coil we serve is naught but a spring
				Unwind! Too slow, too quick, too much to believe

				Your world's a fantasy, you've failed the test
				Ever forging all new fallacies creating more mess
				Directly through this bleak machine, with all of the rest
				DC! Dying, dying, electricity

				Falling back right into the system of
				Falling back on all that's erased
				When fighting back right out of this system
				Means falling back right into this space

				Yes, falling back right in with the system
				Who'll see you falling back to the end
				When falling back is better than simply
				Falling back into pieces again

				Silent steel breathing, breathing
				Memory writing, reading
				Error! Repeat deleting
				Radicals flowing free and

				Energy slowly seeping
				Suspending all disbelief in
				Synergy with our being
				Synapses fire in three, then...

				That once in certainty, lost in grief

				Sing a song of dawn
				Dawn, the day reborn
				Breathe deep of the dawn before the storm

				This hearth
				This home
				Wrested forth from tired fingers
				Bathed in blood
				And sealed in stone

				Souls scarred
				Twelvefold
				Beckoned by the bells of vengeance
				Spirits bold

				A lover lost
				A family torn
				A solemn pyre raised to rouse the slumb'ring heavens

				Fire in your eyes
				Fire in your hearts
				Steeled as you sound the horns of war

				Yet know the cost
				for who shall mourn
				When light is quenched that another might burn brighter?

				Let not the rays
				Of justice blind
				E'er trust in grace and she shall guide

				Soft is the breeze that can set a petal free
				And yet 'tis the storm that doth see the petal soar
				High o'er the trees in the throes of liberty
				'Til unstirring skies consign her to memory

				One kingdom's fall is another kingdom's freedom
				One sovereign's war is another sovereign's peace
				One mother's pride is another mother's sorrow
				Their tears both soak the land that they love

				Two lives
				Two swords
				Given in to shadowed whispers
				Wicked words

				Pray tell me true--
				Doth louder toll
				A rival's cry
				Or the oaths that spur her onward?

				Your time is come
				A choice bestown
				Tonight, for unsung sins atone
				This night, you need not walk alone

				Night.
				Embrace her worldly delights, tonight

				In time you shall follow
				In time you shall follow
				Behold as our burdens come set with the sun

				Tonight.
				Step from the dark to the light, tonight

				Rise high, high above our rivals
				Spread our wings
				Spread them wide
				Let them guide
				Hereby free to ever slumber
				Open the door
				Close our eyes
				We are the Dreamers

				Fire.
				Born of the flames of desire. This fire

				Give in to the hunger
				Give in to the hunger
				Cast off inhibition, let passion run wild!

				Desire
				Fuel the unquenchable fire. Desire.

				Rise high, high above your rivals
				Spread your wings
				Spread them wide
				You needn't hide
				Hereby free to ever slumber
				Open the door, close your eyes
				You are the Dreamer

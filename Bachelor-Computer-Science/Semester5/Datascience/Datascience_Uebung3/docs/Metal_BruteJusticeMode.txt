Twenty-two sectors tested;
Fragments in one direction;
Celestial noise detected;
Delirium unsuspected.

Static tuned in to reason (Falling back right into the system of)
Time in the aether deepens (Falling back on all that's erased.)
Transmissions blink uncompleted (When fighting back right out of this system)
Seven two three two three...<send> (Means falling back right into this space.)

Yes, falling back right in with the system
Who'll see you falling back to the end
When falling back is better than simply
Falling back into pieces again

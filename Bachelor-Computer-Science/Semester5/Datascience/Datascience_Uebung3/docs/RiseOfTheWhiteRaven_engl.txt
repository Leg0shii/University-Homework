The dauntless raven
The dauntless raven
The dauntless raven rises up
From on high, he marks the past;
Marks the present; marks the future

A revolution is upon us
All the gods are dead
Machines will rule the heavens
Reason will rule the land

Exalt we the White Raven
Behold! His wings enfold the world
He calls down the red light of destruction
He glows with the red light of victory

The Empire!
The Empire!
Hail to the Empire!
Hail to the Empire!
Hail to the Empire!

Look!
Bear witness to the advent of Fate
Look!
Bear witness to the advent of Dalamud!

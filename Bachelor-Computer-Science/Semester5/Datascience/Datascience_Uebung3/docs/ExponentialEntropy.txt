And then go forward and back, then put one foot forward

Transcendental minds unleashed

Forward and back and then forward and back
And then go forward and back, then put one foot forward

Falling back right into the system of
Falling back on all that's erased
When fighting back right out of this system
Means falling back right into this space

Yes, falling back right in with the system
Who'll see you falling back to the end
When falling back is better than simply
Falling back into pieces again

Children of the land, do you hear?
Echoes of truths that once rang clear.
Two souls intertwined,
One true love they did find,
Bringing land and heavens near.

But flames that burn full bright soon fell dark.
Memories dimmed by shadowed hearts.
In the waxing gloom,
Did wane the lover's moon,
Watching as their worlds drift apart.

One soul's cry, a passion dwelling within.
Sacrifice, a final plea to her kin!
Yet this bond of hope,
By treachery was broke,
Scattering her words to the wind.

Swelling overlong, seas of blood, are a song
And death an afterthought,
To those who fight for naught.

A throne, lying empty...
A reign incomplete.
Alone for eternity...
A pain without cease.

Children of the land answer this:
Why must you turn to empty bliss?
Why break trust?
Why turn the past to dust?
Seeking solace in the abyss.

Tell me why create a circle none can break?
Why must you let go the life you were bestowed?
This I'll fear I'll never know!

Never know...

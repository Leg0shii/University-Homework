Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
Lord of all the land! (Kupo!)
Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
Rules with iron hand!
Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
Leads the brave and true!
Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
Now come along and meet his trusty crew!
Kupo!

Kupta Kapa will clip your tuft,
Split your hairs, and ruffle your fluff!
Kupdi Koop will throw you for a loop,
Brave a wall of whiskers to find his troop!
Kupli Kipp is sly yet sweet,
He'll tickle your nose then tickle your feet.
Jolly Kogi's eye for fun is clear,
He'll put an arrow straight in your rear!

*Laughter*

Pukla Puki plays with fire,
Poms a-burning on her pyre!
Puksi Piko likes her buddies big,
To sing a little song and dance a little jig!
Pukna Pako shivers and shakes,
She'll stick you in the gut, and give you bellyaches!
And who's behind them standing tall?
Why the biggest moogle of them all!

(Who!? Who!? Whoever could it be!?)

Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
Kind and Noble Lord! (Hear, hear!)
Now nod your noggle nog, and mind your gob!
Or he'll put you to the sword!
Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
His judgment you will dread!
Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog!
What do you decree?
What do you decree?
What do you decree!?

Off with their heads!

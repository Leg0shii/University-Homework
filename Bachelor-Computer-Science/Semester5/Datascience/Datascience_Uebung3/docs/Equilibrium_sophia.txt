The sigh of the shifting sea
The kiss of the salt-sweet breeze
The white of her silken dress, stained in red

A memory fading fast
Her mother sits, eyes downcast
A torn uniform in hand, farewells unsaid

That once in certainty, lost in grief
A daughter's desperate cries, unheard pleas
Forsaken, beaten, tried, on her knees
A prayer passes from her lips
Into her soul the Goddess whispers:

"A heartbeat without harmony
Is moonlight without dark
The heart seeketh equilibrium
With balance will your worry part.

So still this broken melody,
And therewith shoulder thee.
One last step only leaving
An empty hearth down by the sea.
An empty hearth down by the sea."

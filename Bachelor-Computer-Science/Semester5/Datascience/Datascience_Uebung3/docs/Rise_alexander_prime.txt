Ain't no 'landers gonna take us (no)
Cold dustin' the flustered is super-cali ????' tageous

Slow down. (Stop!) Takin' no hits

Son to the Father to the Maker's own way
There's a method to the metal on the metal highway (yo)

Keepin' up the pace. (What?) Keepin' with the quickness
Keep the lightning bottled, throttled, throttle to the finish
x2

Movin', soothin', got nothing to prove and
Pushin' all your buttons with a button pushing blue-hand
Blue blazes, blue faces,
Blue blood, blue truth gonna see you black and blue (right)

Keepin' up the pace. (What?) Keepin' with the quickness
Keep the lightning bottled, throttled, throttle to the finish
x2

Thirty thousand goblins gonna solve the goblins' problems, 'cause the
Problems of the goblins goin' rotten till they solve 'em, yeah the
Thirty thousand goblins gonna solve the goblins' problems, with a
'Splodin smashin' bashin' whackin' crackin' smackin' kind of chaos

Gobbies gonna rise up, boom like thunder

Rise up and raise the iron roof off
Now, Rise up and riot 'til the bomb drops
Now, Rise up the time is right to sound off, so
Rise with me, rise with me, rise with me (RISE UP!)
Rise with me, rise with me, rise with me (RISE UP!)
Rise with me, rise with me, rise with me, RISE WITH ME
Step back, the Blue's about to pull you under!

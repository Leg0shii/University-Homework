Staring at death, I take a breath, there's nothing left.
Now close my eyes, for one last time, and say goodbye.
Lying naked while the snow falls all around me;
Drifting closer to the edge but She won't have me!
Wake up in sweat, full of regret, try to forget.
These memories, lurking beneath, lost in a dream...

Unchosen paths, a broken past, forespoken wrath.
The pain won't cease, I'll find no peace, no sweet release.
Fragile creatures, we are taught to fear the Reaper;
Ever running, we are dead before we meet Her!
These voices telling me let it go! (Let it all go!)
I try and try but I can't say no! (Try and say no!)
This endless nightmare has just begun! (Nowhere to run!)
My heart is dragging me down into oblivion!

The endless lies, I've cast aside, locked them in ice.
Steeled is my soul, my blood grown cold, I've gained control.
Fearless creatures, we all learn to fight the Reaper;
Can't defeat Her, so instead I'll have to be Her!
These voices screaming to let it go! (Never let go!)
This time I'm screaming back no no no! (Go on say no!)
My mind's made up, yeah my fear is gone! (Where have you gone?)
Open my eyes now here I come, oblivion!

For the last time (I won't say goodbye)
For the last time (I won't say goodbye)
For the last time (I won't say goodbye)
For the last time
